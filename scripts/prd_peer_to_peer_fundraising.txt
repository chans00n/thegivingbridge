## 7. Risks and Mitigations

**Technical Challenges:**
    -   **Risk:** Complexity in managing OAuth2 tokens and user sessions securely and reliably with Classy.
    -   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly study Classy API documentation on authentication. Use well-tested OAuth2 libraries. Implement robust error handling and token refresh mechanisms.
    -   **Risk:** Limitations or unexpected behavior in the Classy API.
    -   **Mitigation:** Allocate time for API exploration and testing early in the project. Maintain open communication with Classy support if issues arise. Design flexibly to accommodate potential API constraints.
    -   **Risk:** Implementing an efficient and scalable polling mechanism for near real-time updates without hitting Classy API rate limits.
    -   **Mitigation:** Design polling strategy carefully (e.g., adaptive polling intervals, polling only necessary data). Implement robust error handling for rate limits. Explore batching requests if possible. Clearly communicate that updates are "near real-time."

**Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon:**
    -   **Risk:** Scope creep leading to an overly complex MVP that delays launch and learning.
    -   **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the defined MVP features. Prioritize core functionality that delivers immediate value (user auth, page creation, donation). Gather user feedback early and often to inform subsequent phases.

**UX Complexity:**
    -   **Risk:** Designing a UI that is both highly customizable/branded and intuitive for all user types.
    -   **Mitigation:** Invest in UX research and design upfront. Create detailed wireframes and prototypes. Conduct usability testing with target users throughout the development process.

**Resource Constraints (if applicable):**
    -   **Risk:** Limited development resources impacting timeline or feature set.
    -   **Mitigation:** Phased development approach allows for delivering value incrementally. Prioritize features based on impact and effort. Clearly communicate any resource limitations to stakeholders.

**Dependency on Classy.org:**
    -   **Risk:** Changes in Classy API, pricing, or terms of service impacting the platform.
    -   **Mitigation:** Stay updated with Classy communications. Design the backend with an abstraction layer for Classy API calls, potentially making it easier to adapt to changes or switch providers in the extreme future (though Classy is core to this PRD).

**Security & Compliance:**
    -   **Risk:** Ensuring all custom code and integrations meet security best practices, beyond the PCI compliance handled by Classy for payments.
    -   **Mitigation:** Follow secure coding practices (OWASP Top 10). Conduct security reviews/testing. Ensure data privacy for any locally stored information.

## 8. Appendix

**Research Findings:**
    -   Classy API (v2) documentation (link: https://developers.classy.org/api-docs/v2/) confirms availability of necessary endpoints for campaigns, fundraising pages, teams, transactions, and OAuth2 authentication.
    -   Classy does not offer native webhooks; a custom polling mechanism is required for near real-time updates.
    -   Movember website (inspiration) features strong visual branding, clear calls to action, and prominent progress tracking, which should be emulated.
